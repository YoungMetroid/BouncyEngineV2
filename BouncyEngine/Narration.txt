In the beginning long before the humans 
existed our clan the wolf clan maintained the peace
across the diferent worlds throughtout the universe.
#
The world of earth was always at, since their 
was no superior being with an inteligence matching 
that of our clan. 
#
But that changed once the humans appeared.
At the beginning they were nothing special.
Just another living oraganism. But then we started
#
To notice that they were creatures who helped
eachother, and some started to develop diferent 
interest from one another. 
#
Every human was distinct and had diferent personalities
This intrigued our clan so we decided to keep watching
The humans over many generations expaned throughout the
#
World and developed diferent tecnologies that helped them
create theire homes, protect themselves and allowed them
to hunt.
#
We were fascinated by the fast development but we also started
to notice that they had developed other caracteristics.
That caused conflict between the humans. 
#
We called them the seven sins of dispair.
